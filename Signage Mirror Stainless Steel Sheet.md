## FAQs
**Q1: What is the difference between 304 and 304L stainless steel?**
A1: Both 304 and 304L are austenitic stainless steels. The main difference is that 304L has a lower carbon content, which makes it more resistant to intergranular corrosion after welding.

**Q2: How do I maintain the mirror finish on the sheets?**
A2: Regular cleaning with mild soap and water, followed by drying with a soft cloth, will keep the mirror finish looking pristine. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or tools that could scratch the surface.

**Q3: Can these sheets be customized in terms of size?**
A3: Yes, we offer customization services to meet your specific requirements. Please contact us at +65 83016969 for custom orders.
