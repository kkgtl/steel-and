## FAQs
**Q1: What is the difference between mirror polished and brushed stainless steel?**
A1: Mirror-polished stainless steel has a highly reflective surface, providing a sleek and shiny appearance. Brushed stainless steel has a satin finish with fine parallel lines, offering a more subtle and matte look.

**Q2: How do I clean and maintain the mirror finish on these sheets?**
A2: To keep the mirror finish pristine, use mild soap and water or a non-abrasive cleaner. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that can scratch the surface.

**Q3: Are these sheets suitable for outdoor use?**
A3: While mirror-polished stainless steel offers excellent corrosion resistance, prolonged exposure to harsh weather conditions may affect its appearance. For outdoor use, consider additional protective coatings.
