## FAQs
**Q: What is the difference between 2205 and other stainless steel grades?**
A: The 2205 grade offers a higher level of strength and corrosion resistance compared to traditional austenitic stainless steels like 304 and 316. Its duplex structure provides better mechanical properties and is particularly resistant to chloride stress corrosion cracking.

**Q: How does the etching process affect the sheet?**
A: The etching process creates a textured surface that enhances the aesthetic appearance of the sheet while maintaining its structural integrity. It also improves the sheet's ability to resist staining and corrosion.

**Q: Can I get custom sizes for the sheets?**
A: Yes, we offer custom sizes tailored to your specific needs. Please contact our sales team at +65 83016969 or via email for more information.
