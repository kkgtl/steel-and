## FAQ

**Q1: What makes the 316 grade different from the 304 grade?**
A1: The 316 grade contains molybdenum, which enhances its corrosion resistance, particularly in chloride-rich environments. This makes it ideal for applications where higher resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion is required.

**Q2: How do I clean and maintain the mirror finish?**
A2: Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is recommended. Avoid abrasive cleaners as they can damage the mirror finish. Dry thoroughly after cleaning to prevent water spots.

**Q3: Can I order custom sizes?**
A3: Yes, we offer custom cutting services. Please contact us at +65 83016969 or via email for more details.
