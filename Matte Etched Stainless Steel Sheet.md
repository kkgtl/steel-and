## FAQs

**Q1: What is the difference between matte and glossy stainless steel?**
A1: Matte finishes have a subtle, non-reflective appearance that provides a more modern and understated look. Glossy finishes, on the other hand, offer a shiny, reflective surface that can be more eye-catching.

**Q2: How do I clean and maintain the sheet?**
A2: Use mild soap and water or a non-abrasive cleaner. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive materials to prevent damage to the etched surface.

**Q3: Do you provide custom sizes?**
A3: Yes, we offer custom cutting services to meet your specific requirements. Please contact our sales team at +65 83016969 for more details.
